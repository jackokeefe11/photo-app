What corrections did you have to make?
	We added the username to the alt text to add specificity to the text. 
	Apart from that, we already met the requirements for accessibility that weren’t
	contrary to the assignment outline. 

Given that the photos and captions rely on user-generated content, 
do you think that the accessibility problems are all solvable? Why or why not?

	In an ideal world, all accessibility problems are solvable. Because a percentage 
	of these problems rely on user input, it is not guaranteed that users will 
	ensure accessibility. For example, users should generate alt text captions for 
	their images to help visually impaired people, but I suspect the percentage 
	of people who write alt text is extremely low. Apart from that, it is the developers 
	responsibility to allow for the most accessible application possible without user input. 
	This includes using correct color combinations, text to speech features, and anything else 
	that improves accessibility. 

Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?
	Yes, the website is not as beautiful, but it is certainly usable. 
	All the required features are present and laid out in a logical fashion 
	regardless if the CSS is present or not. 

Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the images? Why or why not?
	Without the images, the website loses massive amount of functionality. 
	Because the website is a “photo application,” disabling images runs contrary to the
	intent of the website. To conclude, the website is usable, but it becomes rather 
	pointless as the images comprise the most important part of the application.
